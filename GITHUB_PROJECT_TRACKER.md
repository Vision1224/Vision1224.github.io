## 🚨 Risk Management

### **Potential Blockers:**
1. **Time Crunch** - 10 days is tight
   - *Mitigation:* Cut to 5 projects if needed
   
2. **Scope Creep** - Projects get too complex
   - *Mitigation:* Stick to MVP features only
   
3. **Technical Issues** - Code doesn't work
   - *Mitigation:* Test early, ask for help
   
4. **Day Job Demands** - Less time than expected
   - *Mitigation:* Have backup "quick win" projects ready

### **Backup Plan:**
If falling behind schedule:
- Cut to 5 projects (drop Tier 3 quick wins)
- Focus on Tier 1 + 2 projects only
- Simplify features to core functionality
- Prioritize documentation over extra features
