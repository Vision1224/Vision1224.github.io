                            Senior technical professional with <strong>10+ years of experience</strong> bridging the gap between complex technology and practical business solutions. Currently leading technical support initiatives at SpyCloud, where I guide enterprise customers through sophisticated cybersecurity challenges while mentoring junior engineers to deliver exceptional service.

Whether debugging 50,000+ line codebases, engineering fraud detection workflows, or leading cross-functional teams through complex system migrations, I approach every challenge with the curiosity of a tinkerer and the precision of a professional.
